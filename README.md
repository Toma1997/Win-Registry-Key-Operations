# Windows-Registry-Operations

This was project for final exam on course Digital Forensics.

1. Key Operations directory contain a simple program to manipulate over Key variables
   Add, Modify, Delete Key in Windows Registry
   I have used 4 functions to manipulate with registry key:
    - Open or create a registry key if it don't exist
    - Set values to registry key variable
    - Get values from registry key variable
    - Delete registry key
 2. Registry Key Backup is a bit more complex program that creates a directory for a specific key in registry,
    and recursively creates directories for his subkeys and files for his values.
